# Eatme co
Food delivery app build with MERN stack with Typescript

## Progress
- [x] front-end app with React + Vite + Typescript
- [ ] back-end server with MongoDB + Express + Typescript

## Description
* In this project i completed the front-end app without back-end server
* To run this code you need to install Node.js first at https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.11.0/node-v22.11.0-x64.msi
* Open your terminal and do type npm install
* Because back-end server is not there yet so i use alternative using json-server with the dummy data at data/products.json
* Type npx json-server data/products.json and wait till the server is on, do not close this server while running the app
* Open new terminal and now type npm run dev, you can see the website hosted at http://localhost:5173 like the common port while using vite
